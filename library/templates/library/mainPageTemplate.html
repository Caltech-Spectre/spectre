                The main purpose of Spectre is to provide Caltech with quality speculative fiction. We have a heavy focus on science fiction but also offer selections from fantasy, historical fiction, alternative histories, relevant nonfiction, and various other genres.

                Any person in the Caltech community is entitled to Spectre membership. Joining is currently ill-defined, but you can start by subscribing to the mailing list (currently, zero traffic, planned low traffic) at <a href="https://hermes.ugcs.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/spectrum">https://hermes.ugcs.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/spectrum</a>. Club membership is free for you, but it helps us get funding.

                We hope to hold at least one Spectre event per term, such as showing a particularly good or particularly bad speculative fiction film, attending a convention, or holding a reading of the Eye of Argon.

                Spectre is happy to accept science fiction and fantasy books from people who are not Caltech undergrads, as well as alumni who have been graduated for at least one year. We institute this waiting period to ensure that people don't give away treasured possessions out of irrational emotions around graduation. Exceptions will be made for anyone who can convince us they don't want to lug books across the country with them.

                We are also willing to negotiate purchases or exchanges if you have books we may be interested in, and have a reasonable budget for buying new materials. Contact us for more information.
